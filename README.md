External link handling

* Not bound to click event
* Vanilla JavaScript, doesn't require jQuery
* Inlined external link icon (base64 = no image dependencies)
* Alt and title attributes pull in current domain name (with fallback)

## Usage

Add ```class="external"``` to links to open in new window/tab **with** disclaimer and icon.

Add ```class="gov"``` to links to open in new window/tab **without** disclaimer or icon.
